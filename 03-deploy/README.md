# 03. Deploy

**The Deploy Phase** is the third phase defined in the **Cloud Native Security Lifecycle**.

This is the Phase where we have build all the artifacts from our code and are ready to deploy them to deploy them to the desired environment (dev/test/prod).

This phase includes actions like:

- pre-flight deploy checks
- signature verification
- the actual deploy

For a practical example of signature verification via Cosign look [here](./signature-verification/).
